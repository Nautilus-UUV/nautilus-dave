"""Sim-only per-timestamp ground-truth anomaly label bridge.

Broadcasts one ``nautilus_msgs/AnomalyLabel`` at a fixed 10 Hz on
``UUVTopics.ANOMALY_LABEL`` so that every timestamp in a recorded bag
is attributable to a class — including timestamps whose anomaly
signature is an *absence* (sensor dropout, comms drops). That is why
this is its own node: it is never routed through any fault or comms
gate, so the label stream stays intact precisely when the faulted
streams go quiet. Parameterized from ``Scenario.anomaly`` via
``compile.params_for_anomaly_label`` (the label block is validated
against ``rig.faults`` at load, so this bridge can never claim
"nominal" while a runtime fault is configured).

``anomaly_class`` / ``channel`` / ``archetype`` are constant for the
run; ``active`` marks when the fault is actually influencing published
data, so dataset builders can use run-level or timestamp-level labels
without label noise:

  nominal    -> always False (an explicit stream in every bag —
                downstream never infers from absence)
  bcu_pump   -> True iff the pump is actuating (last commanded
                /bcu/rpm != 0 AND the motor valve is open — mirroring
                the BCU bridge's flow condition; an idle degraded pump
                produces nominal-looking data. Approximation, by
                design: the ~1 s PumpDynamics decay tail after a
                command drops to 0 is not extended) AND the fault's
                schedule envelope m(t) > 0.
  sensor     -> True iff m(t) > 0: from the onset for step shapes, and
                only during on-windows for intermittent ones. For
                drift this follows the FDI convention: the label marks
                the fault *condition* (present from its onset) even
                while the ramp is sub-noise, so detection delay is a
                measured property of the detector, not baked into the
                labels.
  comms      -> always True (drops are absences in the other streams;
                comms carries no schedule).
  biofouling -> always True (physical hull state from spawn).

The labeled class's schedule arrives under ``schedule_*`` (selected by
``compile.params_for_anomaly_label`` from the matching ``rig.faults``
block). Like every bridge schedule it arms on the first latched
``/command=true`` (see ``SimBridgeNode.declare_fault_schedule``), so
this node's epoch and the faulted bridge's agree to within discovery
latency of the same sample — and ``active`` is always False during
bringup, before the mission physically starts.

Not for hardware — labels are a property of the injected scenario.
