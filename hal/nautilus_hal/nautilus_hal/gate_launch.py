"""Launch-side composition helper for the sim_ready_gate.

Shared by the ``*_sim`` HAL launches so the required-node roster and the
failure wiring live in exactly one place. Import from inside an
``OpaqueFunction`` (like ``render_sdf``) so launch files stay import-light.

The gate's process exit is a *failure* signal by contract — on success it
stays alive holding the /sim/ready latch — so the OnProcessExit handler
can unconditionally turn any exit into a full launch Shutdown, which the
sweep runner reaps (and retries, via the abort_init verdict the gate
writes first).
